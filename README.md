## Introduction

Welcome to the Speaker Recognition with Deep Learning project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to identify and recognize speakers from audio samples using deep learning techniques. It utilizes neural networks to analyze audio data and make predictions about the identity of the speaker.

## Project Overview

The project involves several key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is organized, and noise is added to enhance model robustness.
2. Model Architecture: A deep neural network using residual blocks is designed for speaker recognition.
3. Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed dataset.
4. Validation: The trained model's accuracy is evaluated using a validation dataset.
5. Testing: The model's performance is tested on new audio samples.

## Features

- Speaker identification and recognition from audio samples.
- Data preprocessing including noise addition and frequency domain transformation.
- Customizable model architecture using residual blocks.
- Training, validation, and testing pipelines.

## Usage
Prepare your audio dataset and organize it into appropriate directories.
Configure hyperparameters and settings in the code according to your needs.
Run the code to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of [X]% on the validation dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in recognizing speakers from audio samples. Sample outputs and predictions can be found in the project documentation.
